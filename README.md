This project is a web-based student score prediction application developed using the Python Flask framework. It allows users to input student data such as attendance and study hours through a simple web interface and provides predicted scores based on a pre-trained machine learning model. The app demonstrates integration of machine learning with web development to create an interactive, user-friendly tool for educational performance analysis.

Key features include:

Responsive Flask web interface for data input and result display

Use of a serialized ML model (student_model.pkl) for real-time predictions

Easy deployment on cloud platforms such as Heroku, Railway, or Render

Modular and maintainable project structure with clear separation of templates, static assets, and backend logic

This project is ideal for learners and developers interested in combining machine learning models with web technologies to solve real-world problems.
